💡 My own small frontend framework for learning purpose.

### Why build my own framework?

🔍 I've been working with frontend frameworks for a while now (mainly Angular) and I would like to know a little bit more about the deeper mechanism behind this amazing maze.

### Does it work?

⚙️ I don't think that this framework will be functionnal any time soon, that's just a personnal project with learning purpose. I'm trying my best to play around with differents optimisations but I'm far from a full featured framework.

## Inspiration

📚 I have read quite a lot about the underlying mechanism of frontend frameworks and finally decided to take Vue's approach.
