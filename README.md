üí° My own small frontend framework for learning purpose.

# Introduction

### Why build my own framework?

üîç I've been working with frontend frameworks for a while now (mainly Angular) and I would like to know a little bit more about the deeper mechanism behind this amazing maze.

### Does it work?

‚öôÔ∏è I don't think that this framework will be functionnal any time soon, that's just a personnal project with learning purpose. I'm trying my best to play around with differents optimisations but I'm far from a full featured framework.

# Get Started

```
//Download dependencies
npm i

// Run server on localhost:1234
npm run dev

// Auto compile components
cd compiler
nodemon -e html,js --watch ../components/ --ignore *-render.js --watch .  index.js
```

# Documentation

To create a component you need a directory _mycomponent-component_ with a _mycomponent-component.html_ and a _mycomponent-component.js_.

In the template _mycomponent-component.html_ you can use :

- all your regular _HTML tags_ with _class_ and _id_ :

```html
<h1 class="my_class" id="my_id">My First Heading</h1>
```

- _if_ statement linked to your component state :

```html
<div if="e > 10">Here component.state.e is greater than 10</div>
```

- _for_ loops to iterate :

```html
<ul>
  <li for="i of array">Item {{ i }}</li>
</ul>
```

- events such as _click_, _change_ etc. to interact with your component methods :

```html
<button click="print()">This will call component.print() when clicked</button>
```

## Inspiration

üìö I have read quite a lot about the underlying mechanism of frontend frameworks and finally decided to take Vue's approach.
